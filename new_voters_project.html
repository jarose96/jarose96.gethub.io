                    We&#39re working to make North Carolina&#39s democracy 
                    work better for everyone, starting right here at UNC. 
                    Our democratic institutions and voter participation in 
                    NC are much farther behind the rest of the nation. 
                    Our districts have been deemed racially gerrymandered 
                    and we don&#39t have simple things like online voter 
                    registration, like South Carolina does. We want 
                    Chapel Hill to become a leader in best voting 
                    practices&#8211things like voter registration during new 
                    student orientation, and working towards online voter 
                    registration. So we need your help to make it clear to 
                    our decision makers these practices are easy to implement 
                    and will increase participation in our democracy.
                    <hr>
                    Make voter registration a key part of fall orientation; 
                    support online voter registration (25 states do this); 
                    work with election officials to put early voting sites 
                    on large campuses for major elections; and help make sure 
                    every student not only gets registered, but shows up to 
                    vote. Please help make voting easier!

          <h3>SUPER PACS AND SUPER WEALTHY DOMINATE ELECTIONS</h3>
           <p class="collapse" id="viewdetails3">
               Since the Supreme Court&#39s Citizens United decision in 2010, 
               the super wealthy and the mega donors have gained even more 
               influence in the &#34money election.&#34 
                <br>
                <br>
                Take the recent mid-term elections. Our report The Dominance 
                of Big Money in the 2014 Congressional Elections looked at 25 
                competitive House races, and in those races the top two vote&#8211getters 
                got more than 86 percent of their contributions from large donors. 
                Meanwhile, only two of those candidates raised less than 70 percent 
                of their individual contributions from large donors.
                <br>
                <br>
                This disparity was also on full display in the 2012 presidential 
                election. Combined both candidates raised $313 million from 3.7 
                million small donors &#8211 donors who each gave less than $200. However, 
                that $313 million was matched by just 32 Super PAC donors, who each 
                gave an average of more than $9 million. Think about that: just 32 
                donors &#8211 a small enough number that they could all ride on a 
                school bus together &#8211 were able match the contributions of 3.7 
                million ordinary Americans.
                <br>
                <br>
                So what happens when a handful of super rich donors 
                spend lavishly on elections? For one thing, their money often 
                determines who wins an election. In 2012, 84 percent of House 
                candidates who outspent their opponents in the general election won. 
                <br>
                <br>
                But perhaps the bigger problem is what it does to the public&#39s 
                trust in their democracy, and the faith we all place in our 
                elected officials. Americans&#39 confidence in government is near 
                an all-time low, in large part because many Americans believe 
                that government responds to the wishes of the wealthiest 
                donors &#8211 and not to the interests or needs of regular Americans.

          <h3>TAKING BACK OUR DEMOCRACY</h3>
           <p class="collapse" id="viewdetails4">
               It&#39s time to reclaim our elections. That's why U.S. PIRG 
               has launched our Democracy For The People campaign.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our campaign seeks to overturn the Citizens United 
                decision. We want to pass an amendment to our Constitution 
                declaring that corporations are not people, money is not 
                speech, and our elections are not for sale. To do so, 
                we&#39re going state&#8211by&#8211state, city&#8211by&#8211city 
                to build the support its going to take to win. We&#39ve 
                already helped get 16 states and nearly 600 cities, 
                counties and towns to formally tell Congress that 
                the Constitution must be amended. Getting this 
                across the finish line won&#39t be easy, but it&#39s 
                what&#39s necessary to reclaim our democracy.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the meantime, we&#39re working to amplify the 
                voices of ordinary people in our elections. So we&#39re 
                also working to create systems of incentives and 
                matching funds for small contributions &#8211 systems 
                that are already in place in some cities and counties.

          <h3>THE MONEY ELECTION</h3>
           <p class="collapse" id="viewdetails5">
               One person, one vote: That&#39s how we&#39re 
               taught elections in our democracy are supposed to 
               work. Candidates should compete to win our votes 
               by revealing their vision, credentials and capabilities. 
               We, the people then get to decide who should represent us.
                <br>
                <br>
                Except these days there&#39s another election: Call it the money 
                election. And in the money election, most people 
                don&#39t have any say at all. Instead, a small number 
                of super&#8211wealthy individuals and corporations decide 
                which candidates will raise enough money to run the 
                kind of high&#8211priced campaign it takes to win. This 
                money election starts long before you and I even have 
                a chance to cast our votes, and its consequences are 
                felt long after. On issue after issue, politicians 
                often favor the donors who funded their campaigns 
                over the people they&#39re elected to represent.
